Project for Master in Computer Science For Digital Media

This will be a diary of the project.

Try to use the las version of unity but ARcore has some problem to import some packages that change over the new version.
Downgrade the version to 2018.1 and knows I can run the example of AR in the editor.

Can move fordward without a telehpone so will center in modeling moving the camera. Will read some documentation to, I'm aware that usually the AR systems in phones move the point of view in the camera so I can create a 3d editor moving the camera with the editor and then switch to the pohne when I have acces to one.
